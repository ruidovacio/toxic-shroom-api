# toxic-shroom-api
An API for accessing a database of toxic mushrooms.

The data was obtained from Wikipedia, from these two particular pages:

* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_poisonous_fungus_species
* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_deadly_fungus_species

I made a small scrapper to parse de data from the containing table, splitting each mushroom into its attributes.
